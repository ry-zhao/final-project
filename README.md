# Kalah IO

A web application for people who want to play mancala with others online.

I wanted to build this app for mancala enthusiasts as I felt that the game is underrepresented
and could use an update. Most mancala games I found online looked like they were
created in the noughties and I felt they could use an upgrade featuring a sleaker UI.
In addition, most mancala games online seem to only feature an AI opponent, Kalah IO
uses WebSockets so users can play eachother in real time.
